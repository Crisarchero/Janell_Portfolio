            I'm Janell Brown, an aspiring web developer who's studied at Collin Community College.  I mostly use HTML/CSS and JS, but I've experimented with a variety of programming languages, including
           C# and Python.

            I've loved being able to apply my creativity in a more logical, practical way and am excited to be able to do more!  Besides coding I like to draw, write, or play games to kill time.
